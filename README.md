Certainly! Below is a sample `README.md` file for your GPA & CGPA Calculator project in C++:

# GPA & CGPA Calculator (C++)

This GPA & CGPA Calculator is a C++ program designed to help students calculate their Grade Point Average (GPA) for a specific semester and their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) over multiple semesters. This program is easy to use and provides a clear and structured way to track academic progress.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- **Calculate GPA**: Calculate your GPA based on course credits and grade points for a given semester.
- **Calculate CGPA**: Calculate your CGPA by averaging the GPA scores across multiple semesters.
- **Method Explanation**: Provides the formulas used to calculate GPA and CGPA, helping users understand the process.
- **Recalculate or Exit**: After calculating GPA or CGPA, you can choose to recalculate, return to the main menu, or exit the application.

## üìã How It Works

### 1. GPA Calculation:
**Input Required**: Number of courses, course credits, and grade points.

**Output**:
- Total grade points.
- Total credits.
- GPA of the semester.

### 2. CGPA Calculation:
**Input Required**: Number of semesters and the GPA for each semester.

**Output**: CGPA based on the entered GPA for each semester.

### 3. Method Explanation:
The program provides the formula for calculating both GPA and CGPA.

## üíª Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhimote1211/gpa-cgpa-calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd gpa-cgpa-calculator
   ```

3. **Compile the Program**:
   If you have `g++` installed, compile the program using:
   ```bash
   g++ -o gpa_calculator gpa_calculator.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the Program**:
   Once compiled, run the program:
   ```bash
   ./gpa_calculator
   ```

5. **Interactive Menu**:
   After running the program, a simple text-based menu will appear with the following options:
   - **Calculate GPA**: Calculate GPA for a given semester.
   - **Calculate CGPA**: Calculate CGPA for multiple semesters.
   - **View Methodology**: See the formulae used for GPA and CGPA calculations.
   - **Exit**: Exit the application.

## üöÄ Example Output

### GPA Calculation Example:
```
---------------- GPA Calculating -----------------
How many subject's points do you want to calculate? : 3

Enter the credit for the subject 1 : 3
Enter the point of the subject 1 : 4

Enter the credit for the subject 2 : 4
Enter the point of the subject 2 : 3.5

Enter the credit for the subject 3 : 2
Enter the point of the subject 3 : 3

Total Points: 32.0    Total Credits: 9    Total GPA: 3.56
```

### CGPA Calculation Example:
```
-------------- CGPA Calculating -----------------
How many Semester results do you want input? : 2

Enter Semester 1 Result (GPA): 3.5
Enter Semester 2 Result (GPA): 3.8

************** Your CGPA is 3.65 *************
```

## üî¢ Formulas Used

### GPA Calculation Formula:
```
GPA = Sum of (Credit * Point) / Total of Credits
```

### CGPA Calculation Formula:
```
CGPA = Sum of GPA / Number of Semesters
```
